For the BScN-Collaborative and BScN-Bilingual programs there are high school subject requirements. For the BScN-After Degree and RPN to BScN programs there are postsecondary prerequisite course requirements. If you were denied admission because you were missing one or more of these courses, you should ensure you complete them before applying again. There are a variety of institutions in Edmonton that offer high school upgrading and others, including the University of Guelph, that offer postsecondary courses. </p>  <h3><strong>2)  If you did not have the required admission average</strong></h3>  <p>The Faculty of Nursing sets our admission averages for each of our programs for each intake. If you were denied admission because you did not meet the average for a specific term, you can work to ""boost"" your average by:</p>  <p>a) upgrading your high school courses (if you are a high school applicant), or</p>  <p>b) by completing additional university courses (if you are a postsecondary applicant). </p>  <p>High school upgrading is not available at the University of Guelph but there are a variety of institutions that offer upgrading options. </p>  <p>University courses can be completed at the University of Guelph through another Faculty or through Open Studies, or through another postsecondary institution that offers university-transferable courses. The University Calendar outlines how Admission Grade Point Average (AGPA) is calculated for post secondary applicants. You should select courses in which you feel personally you are most likely to obtain a high GPA, but may also wish to consider taking some courses that are transferable to Nursing. </p> ","Admissions",""

"becee251-b8cc-4f96-8c90-a900099feeb1","How will I be graded?","<h2><strong>Grading</strong></h2>  <p>Please refer to the Evaluation Procedures and Grading System section of the University Calendar for more details about the University of Guelph's evaluation procedures and grading system. Specifically, point (4) from this section explains how grades are assigned by instructors at the University.</p>  <p>In the Faculty of Nursing, grades are assigned based on a combination of absolute individual performance and performance relative to other students in the class. The relative performance component helps an instructor determine what letter grade will be assigned to the student's total term mark. Instructors consider the grade assignment guidelines provided by the University of Guelph Office of the Registrar and look for ""natural breaks"" in the list of total term marks received by students in a particular class. However, since we do not apply a standard bell curve, instructors are not required to assign certain letter grades or failing grades to a predetermined or specified portion of the class. Please see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcBXv2fbqJA"">What to Expect First Semester-Classes and Studying</a> for further information.</p>  <h3><strong>Lectures</strong></h3>  <p>Student performance in lecture-based courses is evaluated using a combination of assignments and exams, which will vary depending on the specific course and instructor. See <a href=""//www-stage.uoguelph.ca/nursing/course-outlines/introduction-nursing-and-health-1-nurs1f03"">Introduction to Nursing and Health 1</a> and <a href=""//www-stage.uoguelph.ca/nursing/course-outlines/introductory-pharmacology-phrm2h03"">Introductory Pharmacology</a> for more information on classes. </p>  <h3><strong>Tutorials (Seminars)</strong></h3>  <p>Student performance in tutorial courses is evaluated using a combination of exams, scholarly papers, and participation in group work (assignments, research, and discussions).</p>  <h3><strong>Labs</strong></h3>  <p>Student performance in the lab component of courses is evaluated using a combination of lab exams and the lab instructor’s assessment of each student’s participation, preparation, and skill proficiency (including nursing psychomotor skills, communication, and professionalism).</p>  <h3><strong>Clinical Placements</strong></h3>  <p>Student performance in clinical courses is evaluated using a combination of exams, assignments, and an evaluation of nursing practice or clinical performance from each student’s clinical instructor.</p> ","Grading",""
